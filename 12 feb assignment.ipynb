    "Answer:In Python, an exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. When an exception occurs, the program stops executing and Python raises an error message, providing information about what went wrong. Exceptions can occur for a variety of reasons, such as invalid input, file not found, network errors, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax errors, on the other hand, are errors that occur when the Python interpreter cannot parse the code because of incorrect syntax. These errors usually occur before the program is executed and prevent the program from running at all. Examples of syntax errors include misspelled keywords, missing colons, incorrect indentation, and other similar errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key differences between exceptions and syntax errors are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Timing of occurrence: Syntax errors occur before the program starts running, while exceptions occur during program execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Cause: Syntax errors are caused by incorrect syntax, whereas exceptions are caused by unexpected situations that occur during program execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Handling: Syntax errors must be fixed by correcting the code, while exceptions can be handled by using try-except blocks, which allow you to catch the exception and handle it in a way that allows the program to continue running.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Error message: Syntax errors usually provide a simple error message indicating the line number and type of error, while exceptions can provide more detailed information about the cause of the error, such as a traceback and a description of the error type."

    "Answer:\n",
    "a. try and else: In Python, the else block can be used along with the try block to specify a code block that should be executed when no exception occurs in the try block. Here's an example: In this code, we are trying to divide two numbers entered by the user. If the user enters invalid input, such as a string instead of a number, a ValueError exception will be raised. If the user enters zero as the second number, a ZeroDivisionError exception will be raised. If neither exception occurs and the division operation is successful, the else block will execute and print the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. finally: In Python, the finally block can be used to specify a block of code that should be executed whether or not an exception occurs in the try block. Here's an example: In this code, we are trying to open a file named \"myfile.txt\" for reading. If an IOErro exception occurs while trying to open the file, the program will print an error message. Regardless of whether or not an exception occurs, the finally block will execute and close the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "c. raise: In Python, the raise statement can be used to raise an exception. Here's an example: In this code, we are defining a function named divide that performs division and raises a ZeroDivisionError exception if the second argument is zero. We are then calling the divide function with arguments 10 and 0 inside a try block. Since the second argument is zero, a ZeroDivisionError exception will be raised and caught in the except block, where we print the error message."
